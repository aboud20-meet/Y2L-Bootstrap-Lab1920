# Bootstrap Lab - Yearlong 2019/20
  
### Part 1: 
1. Create a new file and call it "exercise.html".
2. Create a table layout using a bootstrap grid that includes 3 types of your favorite creatures.  
2.1 The table layout should look similar to this for all types of screens.  
2.2 The **name** needs to be a _link_ to a wiki page about that creature.
