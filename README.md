# Bootstrap Lab - Yearlong 2019/20
  
  
__Don't forget to FORK first! (and then clone)__  
  
### Part 1: 
1. Create a new file and call it "exercise.html".
2. Create a table layout using a bootstrap grid that includes 3 types of your favorite creatures.  
2.1 The table layout should look similar to this for all types of screens.  
2.2 The **name** needs to be a _link_ to a wiki page about that creature.

Show your work to an Instructor or a TA!
<br/>

**Bonus:** <br/>
Open the website you made then right click and inspect element. As you notice, the image isn't compatible with the screen size and can sometimes get out of the borders of the column that includes it. Google how to fix that. (hint: you need to make the image's width compatible with its parent).
<br/><br/>

### Part 2:
Make a carousel that displays the images of the animals you listed previously.
- Add a "Primary" Button with the text "Next", and a "Secondary" Button with the text "Previous".
- Show your work to an instructor or TA

<br/>
**Bonus:** <br/>
Style and design all buttons and links buttons.

### Part 3:
Edit calculator.html for this portion of the lab.<br/>

Open the calculator.html file in your browser (Chrome/ Firefox). What do you see?<br/>
You are right! It's the ugliest thing you've seen all day. <br/><br/>
Your job is to make it look more like a calculator using your knowledge about the Grid layout(rows, columns) and Bootstrap components (Buttons, inputs)<br/> 
Make an interface for a calculator (out of inspiration? click [here](http://cdn.designrshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/calculator-interface-designs-11.jpg) or [here](https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180325/ysq/kisspng-user-interface-design-calculator-dribbble-designer-calculator-5ab71f53c544c2.723624731521950547808.jpg)) <br/>

#### The must-haves for the calculator are: <br/>
- Buttons from 0-9
- Buttons for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication
- A Textbox for showing the result
 
<br/>
**Bonus:** <br/>
Using Javascript, make the calculator work!
